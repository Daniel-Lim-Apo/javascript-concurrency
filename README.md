Tutorial Javascript Concurrency - Examples

Concurrency

Concurrency refers to the ability of a system to manage multiple tasks at the same time. It doesn't necessarily mean that the tasks are running simultaneously (in parallel); instead, they can be interleaved, giving the appearance of simultaneous execution.

In JavaScript, concurrency is primarily achieved through event-driven programming and asynchronous operations, such as callbacks, promises, and async/await.
